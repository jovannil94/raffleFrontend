I have removed the node_modules folder for this submission.

This raffle frontend project was created in hand with my personal raffle backend database (see other file to connect).

To run this entire project the backend must be launched first with nodemon App.js in terminal to run it as local host. Once the backend is running, this app can be launched in another terminal using npm start.

All routes from my backend will work with this project, however, due to the lack of time, I could not complete the navbar and have decided to scrap the idea in order to have a functioning page.

All routes and params work with this front end raffle app and uses routes, passing down of props, uses react hooks, and is entirely functional with some error handling for the user.

I have also tried to replicate a similar aesthetic to the example given, give more time I would have liked to create a UI and other strech goals I had in mind. I installed and used material UI to assist with elements within the app and to have an overall nice appeal.

Dependencies installed: axios, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, material-ui/core, @material-ui/icons
